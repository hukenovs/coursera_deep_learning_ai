# Quiz Week 1
## Introduction to deep learning

### What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?
  - Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.

### Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)
  - We have access to a lot more computational power.
  - We have access to a lot more data.
  - Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.

### Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)
  - Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly.
  - Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea.
  - Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware).

### When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?
  - False

### Which one of these plots represents a ReLU activation function?
  - Fig. 3: (zero where x < 0, and y = x otherwise)

### Images for cat recognition is an example of “structured” data, because it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False?
  - False

### A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?
  - False

### Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)
  - It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.
  - It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).

### In this diagram which we hand-drew in lecture, what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent?
  - x-axis is the amount of data
  - y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.

### Assuming the trends described in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hoping you got the axis labels right), which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)
  - Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
  - Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
